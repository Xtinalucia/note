#Notetaker App: Never Miss Another Day Of Class Again.

No Need for Social Media Exchange!

Don't clog up your Socials/Phone with extra contacts you may forget to delete. Keep your information private.
More challenging coursework may include 3 components for a SINGLE class (Lecture - Lab - Section Component) and meet
5 days/wk! That can quickly add up for a full time student who is juggling multiply courses and a job.
 

WHO IS THIS GOOD FOR???

1. Great for students who prefer to listen during class rather than write.
2. Great for students who prefer to write during class rather than listen.
